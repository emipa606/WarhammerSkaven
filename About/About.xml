For Rimworld 1.3 1.2, 1.1 and 1.0

    Add the skaven.
This mod require Alien Framework.
Load Humanoid Alien Races before this mod.

1.3b:
-Warpmusket
-Improved Ratling

    The ratkins of the under-empire comes to Rimworld.
    The vile and diabolical skaven will stage attacks against your colony with slave rats, clan rats, engineer and seers. Wielding weapons like slingshots, crossbows, various melee weapons up to simple machine guns and poison weapons.
    Trade with the more "friendly" skaven trader clans that offers access to various traders.

    New race: Skaven
    New animal: Rat ogre
    New factions: Under-Empire, Clan Traders
    New weapons: slingshot, crossbow, ratling gun, poison hose/bottle, wind mortar,  warplock pistol
    New apparel: ragged tunics, cloth hoods/rags, padded armour, skaven helmet, gas-mask, Stormvermin plate
    New security: poison mine, manable warp-lightning turret, barricade, Warplock Jezzail

Skaven: Are okay with cramped interiors and don't need to visit the outdoors. They are not effected by general beauty but can still be wowed by impressive dining/bedroom/recreation room.
Smaller bodysize, less nutrition overall but needs to eat more often to keep going, high immunity but less overall health. 
Good miners, doesn't mind "ratty" and "tainted" apparel.
Horned skaven: Overall stonger and tougher. Good researchers.
Rat ogre can be bought from the skaven trade clan, either from visiting their base or contacting one of their caravans.

    Feel free to leave feedback or any general input. 
It's alot easier to tweak a mod with some feedback.

ToDo: Rat ogres "extra stuff", packmasters, plague priest
